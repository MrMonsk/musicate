          I've listened to Coldplay's song "Everglow" maybe 40 times since it was
          released a couple months ago.
          Upon my first listen, I was immediately drawn to it, with its vi-IV-I-Vish
          chord progression reminiscient of all of Coldplay's biggest hits like "Scientist"
          and "A Sky Full of Stars".
